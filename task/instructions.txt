Let's make a mobile news web app!

FILES AND FOLDERS
-----------------
/design - psd and png
/data - item data in static json

WHAT IT DOES
-------------
1. Upon load, data is requested (specified below) via ajax and presented as list items.
2. The list should be vertically scrollable.
3. Selecting an item from the list
   * Animates in the article view
   * Displays the appropriate data in it
   * Changes the list item style to "selected".
4. Clicking on the "list" button toggles the article view.
5. Swiping horizontally on an article, navigates between them (next - rtl swipe, previous - ltr swipe).

BONUS FEATURE
--------------
1. Save json data to localStorage and retrieve from it on next page loads.
2. Font embedding (Open Sans)
3. Retina display adjustments (regarding the button image)

DEV REQUIREMENTS
----------------
* Use object oriented, readable, vanilla code. A JS toolset like jQuery or Zepto is fine but no mobile frameworks.
* Please implement the swipe detection yourself.
* Strive for efficiency and scalability.
* Use HTML5 and CSS3 like a mad man. (Though styling has been kept minimal)
* Make sure it works well on your personal smartphone BUT it should be able to fit any screen width. For instance, changing device orientation or displaying in different screen sizes.

Feel free to contact me for any reason whatsoever.
GOOD LUCK!
